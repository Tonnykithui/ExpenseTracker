Its a simple application that calculates your expenses vs the income.

React, Redux and React-spring

After cloning, run command "npm i" to get all the packages used in the project.
Run the command "npm run server" to get data from our db.json. This is where we store our data since we are not using a backend for the project.
Run the command "npm run start" to get the UI to interact with. Enjoy this art üòÅ.
